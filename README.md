# DesktopLocker
A little tool to practically disable random people peeping on your computer screen while you're doing something.
Please do not use this for malicious intent..

# How To Use
1: Go into the solution file (sln) and edit the form class.\n
2: Edit the readonly string called "pass", edit this to whatever you want the password to be.\n
3: Build the project.\n
4: Tada!!!\n

# Oh no, I forgot the password!
Don't worry, if you ever run it and forget the password, you can always kill the process by restarting your PC (as long as it isn't on startup.)

Wait.. What if I found this researching for a fix because someone used this maliciously?
Good news! A simple fix is opening Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Escape), opening the "More Details" page (Alt + D), opening the options menu (Alt + O), and last but not least, press A (the A key toggles always on top). Now that you have always on top on, look for the process and kill it.
